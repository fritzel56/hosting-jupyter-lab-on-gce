# Hosting a JupyterLab on a Google Cloud Compute Engine

## Motivation

I was taking part in a mentoring program and wanted to find a way that we could share a compute environment. This would allow us to simplify the troubleshooting process as both parties are using the same environment. I decided that JupyterLab hosted in a cloud environment would work well.
